Just short code that will open an excel worksheet in a specified file, and copy it to another worksheet. I was motivated
to do this by needing to automate the collection of identification numbers across multiple excel files. The code below only pulls 
a single cell, but you could copy as many cells as desired with a loop.


Sub dataPullingScript()


  'turn off notification windows and prevent the workbook accessed from momentarily displaying on the screen

  Application.DisplayAlerts = False
  Application.ScreenUpdating = False

  Dim wksht1 As Worksheet
  Dim wkbk1 As Workbook


  `open workbook to be copied from and choose cell to be copied

  Set wkbk1 = Workbooks.Open("\\path\to\file\to\be\copied\from")
  Set wksht1 = Worksheets("name of worksheet to copy from")
  Set copyCell = wksht1.Cells(cell to be copied)


  `open workbook to be copied to and choose cell to be copied to

  Workbooks("excel file to be copied to").Activate
  Worksheets("worksheet to be copied to").Cells(cell to be copied to) = copyCell


  `close workbook copied from without saving any changes

  wkbk1.Close SaveChanges:=False


  `resets default setting for screen updating and display alerts

  Application.DisplayAlerts = True
  Application.ScreenUpdating = True
  

End Sub
