"(This is a slightly harder version of the fix34 problem.) Return an array that contains exactly the same numbers as the given array, but
rearranged so that every 4 is immediately followed by a 5. Do not move the 4's, but every other number may move. The array contains the
same number of 4's and 5's, and every 4 has a number after it that is not a 4." (http://codingbat.com/prob/p125819)



This problem is easily solved by a nested loop, searching through the array for 4's and, whenever one is found, searching back through
the loop for 5's to place behind the 4 in exchange for whatever number is currently behind the 4. While this is a working solution, I
created a much more efficient algorithm that solves the problem without the use of nested loops.



// solution using a nested loop. whenever a four is encountered (which isn't already followed by a five), the loop goes back 
// through and finds a five (which isn't already following a four). that five is then taken and swapped with whatever is behind
// the four found in the outer loop.

public static int[] fix45 (int[] nums) {
		
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
			
		if (nums[i] == 4 && nums[i+1] != 5) {   // if a four is found without a five after it, we search through the array.
				
			for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
					
				if ( j == 0 && nums[j] == 5 ) { nums[j] = nums[i+1];
								nums[i+1] = 5;
					                        continue;            }         // if the first element is a five, this 
								                               // statement ensures it's chosen first.
					
				if ( nums[j] == 5 && nums[j-1] != 4 ) { nums[j] = nums[i+1];
									nums[i+1] = 5;       } // if a five is found without a four
									                       // preceeding it, it's paired with the 
											       // four found in the outer loop.
					
			} // end inner for loop
				
		} // enclose first logical statement
			
	} // end outer for loop

// solution without a nested loop. an array is made which takes in the locations of all the fives found in the original array. once
// all the fives are found, a loop goes through the input array and seeks out any fours. each time one is found, the element after it
// is put where a five was found previously, and that element is replaced with a five. the previous algorithm does the same job, but
// does it in non-linear time, where this algorithm performs the job in linear time.
